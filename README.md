Continuous Algorithms Final Project
- Simha

Compile:
	> javac *.java

Run:
	> java animalSimGUI


Instructions:
	There are two main components of the GUI.

	Option 1:
		Click 'Reset' then 'Start' 
		
		This will show the animation for an instance of the simulation with the initial population for each organism specified in the text box.

		After a certain amount of time, the simulation will stop and display a graph of each species' population over time.

	Option 2:
		Click 'Compute Graph'

		This will find the average population graph by running the simulation for the number of trials specified in the text box and then averaging the results for each run.

		This will not display any graphics on the GUI.
